SPRING SECURITY 
it uses PasswordEncoder(I) to store and password
DelegatingPasswordEncoder is newly added to spring security

sample password generated by spring security password encoder
{bcrypt}$2a$10$.3qiRP5dTr3H6bflxkCPDey5KpNWRILbRArf5pStHQ2PYC85O15Iq

here {bcrypt} is id for used password encoder

CSRF - attack made with the help of stored sensitive cookies

Encryptors(C) provides factory methods to get following encryptors
BytesEncryptor - encrypts the text in byte[]
	Encryptors.stronger("password", "salt");
TextEncryptor
	Encryptors.text("password", "salt");
	Encryptors.queryableText("password", "salt");  this will generate same encryption result, so we can query the same in database

KeyGenerators(C) used to construct diff key generators 
	KeyGenerators.secureRandom(16);
	KeyGenerators.shared(16); same key each time

BCryptPasswordEncoder
default strangh 10, range 4-31
// Create an encoder with strength 16
BCryptPasswordEncoder encoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder(16);
String result = encoder.encode("myPassword");

Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder can be used as well

we can use spring security context in JPA queries as following
select m from Message m where m.to.id = ?#{ principal?.id }

AuthenticationManager > ProviderManager > AuthenticationProvider (DaoAuthenticationProvider or JwtAuthenticationProvider)

AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter
diff types of authetication processing filters are used in order to create a Authentication object from request, which later is passed to AuthenticationManager 
for example UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter

remember me notes
if user selects remember me while login, after browser closed he can still revisit 
his session based the remember me token received after login, based on a condition that the remember me token is still valid
if the token is valid for an hour, you will be remembered for an hour, you dont need to login in that hour
if you revisit session just before the remember me token expires, the session can go on even if the remember me token expired, but next time you will
have to re-login
